# Inquiry About Freelance Opportunity with Hass-Group

Dear Mr. Shalash,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am reaching out as this seemed to be the most accessible way to contact you. I noticed that your company, **Hass-Group**, was seeking a freelancer experienced with **Odoo.sh**.

I specialize in working with **Odoo.sh** and would be thrilled to collaborate with your team. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen delays, I missed the opportunity to meet with the manager earlier,
due to some flight delays that happened.

If the position is still open, I would be delighted to discuss how I can contribute to your projects.

Here is my contact information.
email: mohikel6@gmail.com
phone number: +201000177578

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Mohamed Ayman
